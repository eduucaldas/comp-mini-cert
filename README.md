# Mini-C Compiler

Compiler for a simplified version version of C (called Mini-C), developed in OCaml.

It was developed as a project for a Compilers course (INF564) at Ã‰cole Polytechnique.

## Compile

To generate the compiler, do:
```
$ make
```
This will generate a ``mini-c`` file

## Run

To compile and run a ``.c`` file with the Mini-C Compiler, do:
```
$ ./mini-c test.c
```

This will generate a ``.s`` file with the assembly code. Then, to generate and run the executable file, do:
```
$ gcc test.s -o test -no-pie
$ ./test
```

## Tests

To run the tests, do:
```
$ cd tests
$ ./run -3 ../mini-c
```
